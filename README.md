Final Comments:

The main slogan campaign of the Conservative Party was “Let’s get the Brexit Done”. The slogan appealed to the voters fed up with the lack of decision and action of the government after the 2016 referendum results.

Other aspects of the campaign implied that by leaving the EU, The United Kingdom will get back all the necessary power to implement their own policies without being controlled or regulated by the EU
